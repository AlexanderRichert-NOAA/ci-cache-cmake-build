# ci-cache-cmake-build

## 1. Create workflow to create reference build for each develop branch commit

Create a workflow called, say, cache-reference-build.yml, which will look
something like the following, and will run whenever a commit is merged into
develop:
```yaml
name: 'Cache reference build from merged commit on develop'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'develop'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        path: codedir

    - name: Generate reference build
      uses: AlexanderRichert-NOAA/ci-cache-cmake-build/cache-reference-build@main
      with:
        source-dir: codedir
        build-dir: build
        config-args: -DOPENMP=OFF
```

## 2. Add ci-cache-cmake-build action to regular CI workflows in place of CMake build

Using the custom action might look something like the following. Note that on a
cache miss, it will behave normally, i.e., rebuild from scratch, without
further intervention.
```yaml
name: Build and Test
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04

    steps:

    - name: Installs
      run: sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz 

    - name: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with: 
        path: codedir

    - name: Build
      uses: AlexanderRichert-NOAA/ci-cache-cmake-build/build-code@main
      with:
        source-dir: codedir
        build-dir: build/
        config-args: -DOPENMP=OFF # Use the same CMake args as in the reference build above
    
    - name: test
      run: ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
